# microTetris

Fork of: https://sourceforge.net/projects/microtetris/

Very compact Tetris game for those who want to play where/when they should not: only a tiny gaming area (even 40px high) your headmaster will hardly notice (in case, just press Q or Escape).

## Differences to upstream

- converted to python3
- converted to tkinter
- fixed some bugs
- dropping tiles with space bar instead of down button
